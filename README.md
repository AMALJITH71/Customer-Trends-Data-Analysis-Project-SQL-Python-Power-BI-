# CUSTOMER TRENDS DATA ANALYSIS – END-TO-END RETAIL INSIGHTS USING SQL, PYTHON & POWER BI


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
This repository contains a complete, end-to-end data analytics project that simulates a real-world business environment. The primary goal is to transform raw customer transaction data into meaningful business intelligence — revealing purchase trends, customer behavior patterns, purchase drivers, and actionable insights. The workflow demonstrates the full lifecycle: data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, analysis, visualization, and reporting.  





## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED  

- **Python (pandas, NumPy, …)** — for data cleaning, transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **SQL** — for database operations and querying business-relevant analytics from transactional data  
- **Power BI** — for building interactive dashboards and visualizing insights derived from data  
- **(Optionally) Excel / CSV** — for raw data storage or intermediate data export/import  


 ## OBJECTIVES & USE CASES
This project can be used to:  
- Understand and segment customer behavior (frequency, recency, monetary value, loyalty) to identify high-value customers  
- Analyze purchase patterns, trends, and revenue drivers across customer segments  
- Generate business insights useful for marketing strategy, customer retention, loyalty programs, and sales optimization  
- Provide a portfolio-ready demonstration of a realistic data-driven analytics workflow — from raw data to business insights and visualization   

## PROJECT STRUCTURE & WORKFLOW

- **Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python):** load raw dataset → clean and preprocess data → handle missing values / duplicates / formatting  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** use Python to explore distributions, detect patterns, outliers, and understand data characteristics  
- **Business Analysis & Queries (SQL):** write SQL queries to perform customer segmentation, compute metrics (e.g. total spend, purchase frequency), and derive business-relevant insights  
- **Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI):** build interactive dashboards that present customer segments, trends, KPIs, and support decision-making  
- **Documentation & Reporting:** include notes, summaries, and visual results to explain what the analysis reveals and why it matters  
 ## WHY THIS PROJECT STANDS OUT
- Reflects a full **industry-standard analytics workflow** — not just code experiments, but realistic business problem solving  
- Shows proficiency across **multiple tools and languages** (Python, SQL, Power BI), which is attractive to employers seeking versatile data analysts  
- Demonstrates ability to turn **raw data into strategic insights** — critical thinking, data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and interpretation skills  

##  HOW TO USE / RUN THE PROJECT
  
1. Load the raw dataset using Python (pandas / NumPy) and run the data cleaning & preprocessing scripts  
2. Use the cleaned/prepared dataset to run SQL queries for analysis  
3. Import the processed data into Power BI and build / view the dashboard  
4. Explore the dashboards and results to understand customer behavior, segments, and business-relevant metrics  
##  FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)
- Add predictive modelling (e.g. customer churn prediction, lifetime value forecasting)  
- Extend analysis with demographic or external data (e.g. region, marketing campaigns) to enrich insights  
- Automate data ingestion and dashboard updates for ongoing use in a production-like environment  
- Share interactive dashboards (e.g. via Power BI Service) or export reports for stakeholders
