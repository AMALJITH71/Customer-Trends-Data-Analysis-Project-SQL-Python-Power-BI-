CUSTOMER TRENDS DATA ANALYSIS – END-TO-END RETAIL INSIGHTS USING SQL, PYTHON & POWER BI

📌PROJECT DESCRIPTION

·This project is a full end-to-end data analytics workflow, simulating a corporate-grade analysis pipeline.

·It transforms raw customer transaction data into actionable business insights by combining data cleaning, transformation, querying, statistical analysis, and interactive visualization.

·The aim is to model how customers behave, segment them based on patterns, and provide clear insights that a business can use for strategic decisions (e.g. marketing, retention, loyalty, stock planning).

📌TOOLS & LANGUAGES USED

1) Python — for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data manipulation.
   
2) SQL — to store transaction data, run queries for aggregations like purchase frequency, segmentation, loyalty analysis, churn metrics, purchase drivers, etc.
   
3) Power BI — to create interactive dashboards and visual reports to display insights, trends, segmentation, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

📌WORKFLOW & FEATURES

·Data ingestion and cleaning: load raw transactional data (CSV / dataset) and clean/transform it using Python (e.g. handling missing values, standardizing formats, feature creation).

·Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): using Python to analyze distributions, detect outliers, understand patterns, and prepare data for deeper analysis.

·Database setup & management: import cleaned data into a SQL database, structure tables appropriately (for transactions, customers, products, etc.).

·SQL analytics: write queries to compute metrics like total purchases, frequency, recency, customer segmentation, average order value, loyalty scores, repeat purchase rates, purchase drivers, etc.

·Customer segmentation: group customers based on purchasing behavior, demographic (if available), frequency/recency/monetary value — or other behavior indicators.

·Dashboard & reporting: build interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize customer segments, sales trends over time, product/category performance, customer loyalty, retention/churn patterns, and other KPIs.

·Insight generation: produce business-relevant insights (e.g. identifying high-value customer segments, trends in purchase behaviour, recommendations for retention or marketing strategies).

📌POTENTIAL USES (PROFESSIONAL / BUSINESS)

·As a portfolio project to showcase end-to-end data analytics skills — demonstrates ability to handle raw data, clean, analyze, and present results. Good for interviews or resumes for data-analyst / business-intelligence roles.

·For businesses (retail, e-commerce, subscription, etc.) to understand customer behaviour: identify top customers, segment customers for targeted marketing, optimize product offerings, forecast demand, improve retention.

·For management and strategic decision-making — using dashboards to monitor KPIs, identify customer churn risk, discover purchase trends, and support data-driven decisions.

·As training or internal analytics tool: you can adapt it to real business datasets to replicate analysis and dashboarding for operations, sales tracking, marketing analytics, or churn analysis.

📌WHY THIS PROJECT STANDS OUT

·Covers complete data analytics lifecycle: from raw data → cleaning → database → analysis → visualization → insights — replicating what is done in real business environments.

·Combines multiple tools/technologies (Python, SQL, Power BI), showing versatility and real-world readiness.

·Demonstrates both technical skills (data processing, database queries, scripting) and business acumen (insight generation, visualization, actionable recommendations).

·Results are easily presentable and interpretable — via dashboards — making it easier for non-technical stakeholders (managers, business users) to understand and act on findings.
